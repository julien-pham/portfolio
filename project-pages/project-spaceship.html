          <div class="body-text">
            During my first-year master‚Äôs project, I studied the thermal behavior inside two rockets astronaut capsule during atmospheric re-entry. The objective was to model and simulate the temperature distribution <i>u(x)</i> within the rocket structure by solving a partial differential equation that describes heat propagation with mixed boundary conditions (Neumann, Dirichlet, and Fourier-Robin).
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I learned to code numerical matrix analysis in Python, where I implemented finite element discretizations and solved large sparse linear systems resulting from the variational formulation of the PDE. The variational formulation was done using FreeFEM, a specialized C-based software for solving PDEs with finite elements.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            The core PDE was:
            <div class="body-text" style="text-align: center;">
              ‚àídiv(ùêæ<sub>a</sub> ‚àáu) = f(x,y) in Œ©,
            </div>
            with boundary conditions involving thermal conductivity <i>ùêæ<sub>a</sub></i>, heat source <i>f</i>, and heat transfer coefficients <i>ùõº</i> and <i>ùõΩ</i>. The Fourier-Robin condition, in particular, allowed modeling convective heat exchange on some boundaries, and by varying the heat transfer coefficient <i>ùõΩ</i>, I showed how it converges to a Dirichlet condition.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I formulated the problem variationally and discretized it into a linear system <i>ùê¥ùëà = ùêπ</i>, where <i>ùê¥</i> is symmetric positive definite and sparse. This structure enabled the use of efficient solvers such as the Cholesky decomposition and the conjugate gradient method.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            To better understand the physical phenomena and the sensitivity of the system, I performed simulations by varying parameters such as the thickness of the thermal shield, the speed of the rocket, and the external temperature. These simulations allowed me to identify which parameters most strongly influence the internal temperature distribution and the effectiveness of the thermal shield.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            This project was my first opportunity to combine advanced mathematical modeling, numerical linear algebra, and programming skills to solve a real-world engineering problem in aerospace. It helped me solidify my understanding of PDEs, variational methods, and numerical analysis. The work culminated in a comprehensive report of over 80 pages detailing the theoretical and technical aspects of the analysis.
