            This project was my research paper (m√©moire) for the end of the first year of Master's (M1). It involved a detailed mathematical study of classical population dynamics models, focusing on the Volterra-Lotka predator-prey system and the Verhulst logistic growth equation. I manually calculated the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability to deeply understand the system behavior.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            To complement the theoretical work, I implemented numerical simulations and phase portrait visualizations using Python. These computational models were essential to validate my analytical results and supported the development of an original hybrid model combining predator-prey interactions with logistic growth, further explored through simulations.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            The complete hybrid model I studied was described by the following system of differential equations:

            $$
            \begin{cases}
              \frac{dx}{dt} = ax \left(1 - \frac{x}{M}\right) - bxy - qEx \\
              \frac{dy}{dt} = -cy + dxy - \tilde{q}\tilde{E}y
            \end{cases}
            $$

            where:
            <ul>
              <li>$a$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the prey.</li>
              <li>$b$ is the predation rate coefficient.</li>
              <li>$c$ is the natural death rate of the predators.</li>
              <li>$d$ is the reproduction rate of predators based on prey consumed.</li>
              <li>$M$ is the environmental carrying capacity for the prey.</li>
              <li>$E, \tilde{E}$ represent fishing effort on prey and predator respectively.</li>
              <li>$q, \tilde{q}$ are catchability coefficients for each species.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">
            This project significantly enhanced my knowledge of differential equations and provided me with my first hands-on experience in population dynamics modeling. The work culminated in a comprehensive report of over 50 pages detailing the theoretical and practical insights gained.
