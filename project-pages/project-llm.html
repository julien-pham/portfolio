            This project was completed during my masterâ€™s (M2) internship. It involved updating a white paper centered on Artificial Intelligence applied to the security of digital payment systems. My main contribution was the detailed drafting of sections covering AI fundamentals, including large language models (LLMs), generative AI (GenAI), and the regulatory environment shaped by the AI Act.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            I addressed key ethical and regulatory challenges such as algorithmic bias, personal data privacy, and compliance with GDPR. I conducted research on innovative data approaches like synthetic data generation and federated learning to mitigate these issues. Additionally, I detailed fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and RAG, which enable efficient adaptation of LLMs to specific use cases while controlling computational costs.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            Parallel to the writing, I developed a prototype conversational agent built on a local LLM capable of answering user questions by semantically searching PDFs. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of LLM internals and strengthened my programming skills. I presented the project to an internal team.
