            This project was completed during my masterâ€™s (M2) internship. It involved updating a white paper led by my supervisor Florence, focusing on Artificial Intelligence applied to the security of digital payment systems. My main contribution was the detailed drafting of sections covering AI fundamentals, including large language models (LLMs), generative AI (GenAI), and the regulatory landscape shaped by the AI Act.

          <div class="body-text">
            I addressed key ethical and regulatory challenges such as algorithmic bias, personal data privacy, and compliance with GDPR. I conducted research on innovative solutions like synthetic data generation and federated learning to mitigate these issues. I also introduced fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA and RAG, which allow for adapting LLMs to specific use cases while keeping computational costs low.

          <div class="body-text">
            Alongside the writing, I developed a prototype conversational agent based on a local LLM capable of answering user queries by semantically retrieving relevant content from uploaded PDFs. This hands-on project enhanced my understanding of LLM architecture and improved my technical programming skills.

            I had the opportunity to present this work at SAS Innovate On Tour Paris 2025, the largest SAS event in France, with over 280 registered participants. Presenting at this event was a valuable opportunity to share our AI-driven vision for securing digital payments with industry professionals and experts.
